# TwoParticleQFT

Welcome to the TwoParticleQFT documentation site! [This site](https://nepomukritz.github.io/TwoParticleQFT/) aims to provide a comprehensive overview of two-particle quantities in quantum field theory, with a focus on their applications in strongly correlated electron systems. We cover the fundamental definitions, diagrammatic representations, and key concepts needed to understand and work with two-particle vertices, correlation functions, and related quantities.

In addition, we include some technical derivations, complementing the main text, which are often omitted in papers for the sake of brevity.
