## Technical derivations

Here, we include some technical derivations that complement the main text. They are often omitted in papers for the sake of brevity, but we include them here for completeness and reference them throughout the main articles above.

- [Second-order perturbation theory contributions to the vertex](vertex_PT2.md)

:::{important} Wishlist
This site is still under construction. Below is a wishlist of tasks to be completed and sections to be added, in decreasing order of priority:

- Add nice-looking vector graphics for all diagrams
- Add a section on frequency parametrizations
- Add a section on spin parametrizations
- Add a note on the amiguity in the literature regarding the definition of the two particle-hole channels
- Add a section on parquet theory, including Bethe-Salpeter equations and Schwinger-Dyson equation. Bonus: Their explicit derivations would be great too.
- Add a section on the SBE decomposition and approximation
- Add a section on asymptotic decomposition of the two-particle vertex
- Add a section on generalized susceptibilities, maybe even as part of the basic definitions
- Add a section on the Keldysh formalism in the steady state (including thermal equilibrium), highlighting the differences to the Matsubara formalism
- Add a bibliography, especially specifying which papers we mean when we talk about the "Vienna" or "Munich" conventions

Beyond that, we could think of adding sections on more methods, as desired. Suitable topics could be:
- Functional renormalization group (fRG) and its multiloop extension
- Spectral representation of two-particle quantities
- Non-local extensions of DMFT, such as
    - GW+DMFT
    - Dynamical vertex approximation (D$Γ$A)
    - Dual fermion approach
    - Finite-difference parquet method
    - DMF$^2$RG
